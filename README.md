# P4-Implementation-of-Chatbot-using-NLP
This project implements a chatbot using NLP techniques to understand user intents and provide responses based on predefined patterns. It leverages the `nltk` library for text processing, `scikit-learn` for machine learning, and `streamlit` for building an interactive web interface, ensuring efficient and user-friendly communication.

Chatbot using NLP

Overview
This project implements a chatbot using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The chatbot is designed to understand user intents and provide appropriate responses based on predefined patterns and responses. It utilizes the nltk library for natural language processing, scikit-learn for machine learning, and streamlit for creating an interactive web interface.

Features
-Understands various user intents such as greetings, farewells, gratitude, and more.
-Provides relevant responses based on user input.
-Maintains a conversation history that can be viewed by the user.
-Built using Python and leverages popular libraries for NLP and machine learning.

Technologies Used
-Python
-NLTK for natural language processing
-Scikit-learn for machine learning algorithms
-Streamlit for building the interactive web interface
-JSON for storing intent data

Intents Data
The chatbot's behavior is defined by the intents.json file, which contains various tags, patterns, and responses. You can modify this file to add new intents or change existing ones.

Conversation History
The chatbot saves the conversation history in a CSV file (chat_log.csv). You can view past interactions by selecting the "Conversation History" option in the sidebar.
